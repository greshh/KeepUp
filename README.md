***Completed:** May 14th 2023*

For a second year course: Games Programming

*`GameEngine.java`Â was developed by the Massey University lecturers and was already provided to be used for the assignment.*

## Scenario
Keep Up has a ball that bounces around the screen - the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and has to prevent the ball from hitting the bottom of the screen.

1. The ball starts off at the centre of the screen and should move in a random
direction.
2. The ball should be accelerated downwards due to gravity.
3. The ball should bounce off each wall (including the top wall).
4. The user can move their paddle left/right using the left/right arrow keys.
5. If the ball hits the paddle, the ball bounces up and the player scores 1 point.
6. Each time the ball hits the paddle, the ball's speed should increase.
7. The user can restart the game by pressing the spacebar key.
